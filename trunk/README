%% This file is a part of thailatex package ver 0.2.2-pre4

thailatex is a Thai package which enables typesetting Thai with LaTeX's 
standard document classes. It is meant to become a part of "babel", 
a multilingual package for LaTeX which supports a lot of non-American 
languages.

Usage
In LaTeX2e, you can tell LaTeX that the document would be written in 
Thai by adding 2 lines in the preamble as follows:

\usepackage[thai]{babel}
\usepackage{thswitch}

An example of using thailatex can be found in the file 'orchid.tex'.

If you patch babel.sty with the script patch-babel located in babel
directory distributed with the source. You may use babel as follows:

\document[thai]{article}

\usepackage{babel}
\usepackage{thswitch}

Note that option [thai] will be passed to babel after it is patched.
You may have to repatch babel.sty again if you reinstall LaTeX.
