thailatex (0.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * thailatex now supports UTF-8 documents, with the aids of inputenc package.
    See /usr/share/doc/examples/utf-example.tex.gz for an example.  (You will
    need additional textlive-lang-* packages if you want to compile it.)
  * If you use swath to insert word breaks in UTF-8 documents, do not forget to
    add '-u u,u' command-line argument.
  * The '\thai' backward-compatible command is no longer provided in this
    version.  Use '\thaitext' instead in your documents.
