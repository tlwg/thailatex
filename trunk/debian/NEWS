thailatex (0.4.6-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Built-in fonts have now been split out to latex-fonts-thai-tlwg package.

  If your old Thai LaTeX documents do not use 'thswitch' package,
  font families will not be switched with \sffamily or \ttfamily commands.
  Only the default one will be used throughout the document.

  To allow font switching, it is now recommended to \usepackage{fonts-tlwg}.
  It is currently equivalent to \usepackage{thswitch}, but the latter is
  deprecated soon, to allow alternative Thai font packages to come.

thailatex (0.4.5-1) unstable; urgency=low

  thailatex now supports Pali/Sanskrit text with descender-less YO YING
  and THO THAN, as well as NIKHAHIT over SARA I (no need for workaround
  using SARA UE as seen in many documents).  Just use \textpali{...}
  command.

  If you are using TIS-620 encoding with Pali/Sanskrit text, you will need
  'inputenc' package with 'tis620' option to make it work properly.

thailatex (0.4.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * thailatex now supports UTF-8 documents, with the aids of inputenc package.
    See /usr/share/doc/examples/utf-example.tex.gz for an example.  (You will
    need additional textlive-lang-* packages if you want to compile it.)
  * If you use swath to insert word breaks in UTF-8 documents, do not forget to
    add '-u u,u' command-line argument.
  * The '\thai' backward-compatible command is no longer provided in this
    version.  Use '\thaitext' instead in your documents.
