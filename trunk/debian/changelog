thailatex (0.3.7-2) unstable; urgency=high

  * Urgency high due to RC bug fix.
  * Fix upgrading from sarge:
      - Remove diversion at postinst instead of preinst.  Also move away the
        babel.sty before removing, and move it back afterward, to make
        dpkg-divert work.
    Thanks to Bill Allombert for discovering the bug and to Steve Langasek
    for the solution.  (Closes: #393519)
  * Add subversion to babel.sty to distinguish it from babel original.
    Thanks to Frank Küster for suggesting.
  * Bumped standard version to 3.7.2.2, no changes needed.
  * debian/watch: Added.
  * debian/copyright:
      - Clarify original authors and current maintainers info.
      - Remove irrelevant tetex-base license terms.

  * New maintainer (Closes:357871)
    Thanks to Frank Küster for intensive sponsoring
  * New upstream release
    - updated fonts
    - new Loma font
    - new TDS conformance
    - addressed some fixes in 0.3.2-0.1 NMU
  * Acknowledged NMU, with some fixes addressed upstream
    (Closes: #318384, #338619)
  * Repackaged as non-native. (Closes: #344554)
  * Bumped standards version to 3.6.2.2, with following changes:
    - converted changelog to UTF-8
  * General changes
    + debian/control:
      - put myself as the maintainer
      - Build-Depends, rather than Build-Depends-Indep, on debhelper
      - added optional dependencies on texlive-base-bin and texlive-latex-base,
        thanks to Norbert Preining's suggestion
    + debian/rules:
      - used $DESTDIR instead of $prefix when "make install". This is the way
        upstream has prepared for package building.
      - removed unneeded dh_strip
      - changed DH_COMPAT to 4
    + debian/conffiles:
      - removed, as we moved to debhelper compat level 4
  * Used dh_installtex to install fonts
    + debian/control:
      - build-depends on tex-common >= 0.19 for a working dh_installtex
      - added ${misc:Depends} and depended on tetex >= 3.0
    + debian/rules:
      - installed map config file with dh_installtex
    + debian/10thailatex.cfg:
      - renamed to "maps", and let dh_installtex handle it
    + debian/dirs:
      - removed /etc/texmf/updmap.d, as it's now handled by dh_installtex
    + debian/postinst, debian/postrm:
      - removed, as they are now replaced by dh_installtex auto-generated
        scripts (Thanks to Norbert Preining for pointing out)
  * Do not install thai.map under TEXMFSYSCONFIG
    + debian/rules:
      - removed thai.map installation, left it where upstream installed it
    + debian/dirs:
      - removed /etc/texmf/dvips, as we wouldn't install thai.map there any more
    + debian/preinst:
      - removed /etc/texmf/dvips/thai.map if unchanged from previous version
  * Docs management
    + debian/rules, debian/docs:
      - replaced manual upstream ChangeLog installation with
        dh_installchangelogs

thailatex (0.3.2-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * NMU to fix RC bug: closes: #318384
  * Fix upstream Makefile to not call install-data-hook
  * Invoke updmap-sys instead of updmap, but fall back to updmap if
    updmap-sys is not found (only needed for sarge backports).
  * Update debian/babel.sty so that all new languages provided by
    teTeX-3.0 are still available when thailatex is installed.
    dpkg-diverting the file is no longer necessary, since teTeX's file is
    at a different place (closes: #338619).
