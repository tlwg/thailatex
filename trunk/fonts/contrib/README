===========

You will need recent tetex (or other, 2.0.2 in Debian Sid is the test
platform).

 1. cd to src directory
 2. run ./create.sh
 3. copy files to TDS (/usr/share/texmf/* in Debiad Sid)
     tex/* to tex/generic/babel/thai
     vf/*  to fonts/vf/public/thai
     tfm/* to fonts/vf/public/thai
 4. run texhash
 5. test latex with files in test directory; you would need to set up
    belleek math font for thaiengmixed.tex though, however, replacing
    mathptmx for mathtime should be fine.
