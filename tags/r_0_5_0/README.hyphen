Notes on hyphenation setup.

ThaiLaTeX >= 0.5.0 comes with hyphenation patterns.  However, due to different
TeXLive FSH on different systems, the installation cannot be automated.  You
will need to modify your system manually after installation.

What you need is add this line to your "language.dat" file:

---8<---
thai  loadhyph-th.tex
---8<---

And then invoke "fmtutil-sys --all".  That's all.

However, the way to modify "language.dat" differs from systems to systems.
For example:

Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

Mostly, you don't need to modify anything if you install thailatex from their
official apt repositories.  But just in case you want to install it from
source:

# cat > /etc/texmf/hyphen.d/90thailatex.cnf << EOF
name=thai file=loadhyph-th.tex lefthyphenmin=2 righthyphenmin=3
EOF
# update-language
# update-fmtutil

The file /var/lib/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.* for different TeX
engines will be refreshed simultaneously.

After that, you can invoke this to regenerate hyphention trie:

# fmtutil-sys --all

Fedora 17
---------

For Fedora 17's TeXLive 2007, the "language.dat" file is located at
/usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/config/.  I am not sure how to modify it the
right way.  You are supposed to create "language.th.dat" file and invoke
some command to update "language.dat" accordingly.  But I cannot figure out
the command.  So, the quick way to do it is edit the "language.dat" file
directly, by adding our required line.  For example:

# echo "thai  loadhyph-th.tex" \
  >> /usr/share/texmf/tex/generic/config/language.dat

And then, as usual, invoke:

# fmtutil-sys --all
