%% This file is a part of thailatex package

thailatex is a Thai package which enables typesetting Thai with LaTeX's 
standard document classes. It is meant to become a part of "babel", 
a multilingual package for LaTeX which supports a lot of non-American 
languages.

* Usage

In LaTeX2e, you can tell LaTeX that the document would be written in Thai by
using the "babel" package with "thai" option, as follows:

  \usepackage[thai]{babel}

In case you want to use UTF-8 encoding, use the 'inputenc' package like this:

  \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}

To use Thai fonts, such as "fonts-tlwg", just use the font package:

  \usepackage{fonts-tlwg}

An example of using thailatex can be found in the file 'orchid.tex'.

If you patch babel.sty with the script sync-babel located in babel
directory distributed with the source. You may use babel as follows:

  \document[thai]{article}

  \usepackage{babel}
  \usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}
  \usepackage{fonts-tlwg}

Note that option [thai] will be passed to babel after it is patched.
You may have to repatch babel.sty again if you reinstall LaTeX.
