MAINTAINERSHIP

thailatex was originally created by Surapan Meknavin in 1999, as a project
under the National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC).
Granted by its license terms, it has been later imported to a public CVS and 
maintained by Thai Linux Working Group (TLWG) community since version 0.2
in 2000.

RELICENSING

Before version 0.4.0, thailatex was released under non-commercial license:

The particular term has been found to break Debian Free Software Guidelines
(DFSG), as well as Open Source Definitions, by limiting the users' rights
to use the software in commercial cases:
 
  2. No charge more than random data distribution cost is associated with
     the redistributions.

Therefore, a proposed idea is to relicense it to The LaTeX Project Public
License (LPPL), to conform to DFSG and OSD, as well as to be compatible to
other parts of Babel package, the target of the project.

Although most of its maintainership over 6 years is done by TLWG members,
that is done under the license terms granted by NECTEC, the copyright holder.

Hence, the original author and copyright holder have been contacted for a
grant to relicense it to The LaTeX Project Public License (LPPL).

The original author's response is positive:

  Dear Thep,
  
  Assuming that LPPL does not conflict with DFSG, I agree that the thailatex
  package should be licensed under LPPL. I don't think there should be any
  problem to remove the term you mentioned to make it free, as no one involved
  in the package wants to make any money out of this since the beginning and
  the term may be just there because we didn't aware of it. However, because
  NECTEC is the entity who is taking care of thailatex package K. Kamthorn may
  be the right person to help realize this.
  
  Best,
  Surapan

  Dear Theppitak

  Subject: Thai LaTeX Relicensing

  The thailatex package owned by NECTEC is currently distributed under
  non-commercial license, which is found to break open source definitions.
  To make it true open source according to NECTEC's original intention,
  and to be compatible with upstream source into which it is aimed to
  merge, NECTEC agrees to change the license terms to the LaTeX Project
  Public License (LPPL), and hereby assigns Mr. Theppitak Karoonboonyanan
  from Thai Linux Working Group (TLWG) to proceed the relicensing, and to
  maintain the project as the Current Maintainer, as specified in the
  license.

  Dr.Pansak Siriruchatapong

  Director of National Electronics and Computer Technology Center (NECTEC)

Therefore, thailatex is licensed under the LaTeX Project Public License
(LPPL) since version 0.4.0.
